## Introduction to Git

What is Git?

Git is a version control system that allows you to track changes to files and folders. It is a distributed version control system, which means that every developer has a full copy of the entire history of the project. This allows developers to work offline and collaborate with other developers.

The Most Important Git Commands

- git add - adds a file to the staging area (the area where changes are prepared to be committed)
- git commit - commits changes from the staging area to the repository
- git push - pushes changes from the local repository to the remote repository
- git pull - pulls changes from the remote repository to the local repository
- git clone - clones a remote repository to the local machine
- git status - shows the status of the local repository
- git branch - shows the branches in the local repository
- git checkout(-b) - switches between branches in the local repository
    - git checkout -b <branch-name> - creates a new branch and switches to it

## Git Workflow

The Git workflow is a set of steps that developers follow when using Git. The workflow is different for each team, but there are some common steps that most teams follow.

1. Create a new branch for the feature you are working on
2. Make changes to the code
3. Add and commit the changes
4. Push the changes to the remote repository
5. Create a pull request
6. Merge the pull request

Basically you should watch video or take a few days training to learn git. It will help you a lot in future.
